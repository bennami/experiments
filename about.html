        Welcome to my lab space. I often find myself trying to make stuff with code. most of the times I do it to learn a certain skill and challenge myself.
        So I dedicated a page on the internet to my little and not so little experiments. It all started with P5js, then I moved on to Three.js. Who knows what I'll do next. I guess You can always keepp an eye on this little site.
        Feel free to connect and suggest, critisize and do it better. You might get featured :)
